# Contribution Guide

For wiki contributions, try to keep markdown files out of 
the miscWikiPages folder. This folder is for wiki files that 
don't belong to a folder in the code. Build the wiki with 
`npm run wiki-build`. To update the wiki, you must push to the
wiki repo.


Try to write tests for the updates you made. Documenting your 
manual tests would be nice, but it is not expected. You can 
read more about manual 
tests [here.](https://github.com/petekeller2/epilogue-starter-kit/wiki/Manual-Tests) 

Write and maintain JSDoc comments and flow annotations.

Check if the tests pass (`gulp unit-test`, `test-server` 
and `test-staging-server`).
