A starter kit using an Express implementation of Epilogue. It handles
generic functionality like authentication and authorization 
as well as repetitive tasks like setting up 
Epilogue resources and milestones.

# Getting Started

Put your credentials into src/config.js. After that, you can start by adding or editing 
resources in the resources folder. To learn more about resources 
in Epilogue Starter Kit, [read this.](https://github.com/petekeller2/epilogue-starter-kit/wiki/Resources) 
You should read Epilogue's documentation as well to fully understand resources 
and milestones.
